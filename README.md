# LPV
This algorithm exhibits a robust Energy Management Strategy (EMS) for battery-super capacitor (SC) Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS). The proposed algorithm, dedicated to an electric vehicular application, it is based on a self-gain scheduled controller, which guarantees the H performance for a class of linear parameter varying (LPV) systems.
