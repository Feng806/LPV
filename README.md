# LPV
This algorithm exhibits a robust Energy Management Strategy (EMS) for battery-super capacitor (SC) Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS). The proposed algorithm, dedicated to an electric vehicular application, it is based on a self-gain scheduled controller, which guarantees the H performance for a class of linear parameter varying (LPV) systems.
First; You have to excute the LPVMEhdi.m 
Secondly; the controller gain is calculated through the Gain_Mehdi.m file.
Finally, run the Simulink File.

Good Luck
